                <p>Atomic&#x27;s vision for a decentralized AI company has captivated a large number of people in the
                    arenas of Artificial Intelligence and computer science, who have yearned for an alternative to the
                    top-down world being created by our current technology giants. However the promise of what Atomic
                    is and can be has been masked by large technical barriers to understanding, and thus has not been
                    well digested by non-technical audiences.</p>
                <p>The purpose of this article is to answer<strong> why Atomic matters to the world, why you should
                        care </strong> and<strong> why we need to build it together</strong>. These are core questions,
                    and each of them will require that we delve into the history of cryptocurrency, and how Atomic is
                    uniquely positioned to play a significant role in the future that is being written today.</p>

                <p class="page_subtitle__JoR3B">Summary</p>
                <p>The invention of Bitcoin was a revolutionary moment for humanity because it introduced two
                    simultaneously united yet distinct technological innovations, reshaping the way that humans organize
                    themselves. Primarily, it was the first ever decentralized currency, which gave humanity a shared
                    value system - one that could not be mutated by vested or centralized interests. With this, Bitcoin
                    promised a future of fair, anti-fiat, finance.</p>
                <p>Secondly and to achieve this aim, it birthed the original, disseminated, and permissionless digital
                    commodity market. This second point has not been overlooked by anyone who has been watching closely
                    - the Bitcoin network&#x27;s computational power, measured in raw hashing power, has blast past the
                    potential of any company or government.</p>
                <p>Atomic is essentially a language for writing numerous decentralized commodity markets, or
                    &#x27;subnets&#x27;, situated under a unified token system. These distinct markets function through
                    Atomic&#x27;s blockchain, allowing each to interact and join into a singular computing
                    infrastructure. By analogy, Atomic brings the same type of abstraction which Ethereum added to
                    Bitcoin for running decentralized contracts, but onto Bitcoin&#x27;s inverse innovation — <i>digital
                        markets</i>.</p>
                <p>Compared to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies attempting to leverage the digital marketplace,
                    Atomic has built a framework that provides ease for creating these viable and enormously powerful
                    systems. However, its genius lies in the fact that every one of these inter-networked markets is
                    connectable, and available, to the whole. Building a hierarchical web of resources, ultimately
                    culminating in the production of intelligence; intelligence leverages computation, which leverages
                    data, which leverages storage, then finally leveraging oracles and data procurement and into
                    infinity, all within the same ecosystem.</p>
                <p>This is Atomic&#x27;s overarching vision; directing the power of digital markets towards
                    society&#x27;s most important digital commodity - Artificial Intelligence. Not only to build the
                    most powerful intelligence network, but also to ensure that the benefits and <i>the ownership</i> of
                    machine intelligence are in the hands of mere mortals. Bottom up, rather than top down.</p>
                <p>Atomic&#x27;s goal and function of this technological foundation has several implications. For
                    developers, a language to write markets for bespoke commodities such as compute, allowing them to
                    take advantage of the enormous size, cost-efficiency and natural functionality of decentralized
                    market systems. For front-end customers, Atomic offers access to resources at a cheaper price and
                    without intermediary;<i>unclosable</i>, not falsely self-proclaimed as “open”. For the Atomic
                    network as a whole, to create Machine Intelligence, in an open and equitable manner on top of
                    ordered and dependent sub-markets. And finally - for the world, to ensure that the supremely
                    important commodity of intelligence is owned by everyone.</p>
                <p>Atomic is, in a similar way, also a computer - albeit one with differing problems such as market
                    misalignments - but one that is <i>programmable</i>, with the potential to become the most powerful
                    ever created. And, it is a <i>shared</i> computer - not directly owned by any single entity, and
                    available for anyone&#x27;s use. To run, govern, contribute to, and importantly <i>profit</i> from
                    the technological products it produces.</p>

            <section class="page_section__IuIy3">
                <p class="page_subtitle__JoR3B">Understanding Atomic</p>
                <p>Understanding Atomic is difficult for the exact same reason that it is powerful. This is because
                    the majority of Atomic&#x27;s computational power is not concretely defined, but instead
                    abstracted <i>underneath markets</i>. For instance, Atomic leverages machine learning models to
                    produce intelligence products, but Atomic also leverages physical storage to create storage
                    products. Meanwhile, it does<i> not define</i> the specifics of how these resources are produced.
                    Instead, Atomic simply defines <i>the market</i> which will reward those commodities for becoming
                    available to the network.</p>
                <p>Abstractions like this are the crucial element to how Atomic is able to leverage enormous swaths
                    of resources: without defining the way in which a computer interacts with Atomic&#x27;s markets,
                    the market leaves space for innovation around<!-- --> <i> how </i>that problem will be solved. In
                    other words, without directly purchasing or inventing the computers that plug themselves into the
                    network, that problem is left to thousands of incredibly talented individuals all across the Earth,
                    who achieve that aim in various and creative ways.</p>

            <section class="page_section__IuIy3">
                <p class="page_subtitle__JoR3B">Atomic vs Bitcoin</p>
                <p>As a good starting point for understanding how the rubber hits the road, we can start by comparing
                    Atomic to Bitcoin. We use Bitcoin as it is the ultimate example of digital markets in action, and
                    has the benefit of being well understood by many already.</p>
                <p>Bitcoin is secured by a game theoretic equilibrium, whereby it is much more profitable for miners to
                    accurately and truthfully replicate the state of Bitcoin&#x27;s account balances, rather than
                    diverge or create false histories. Bitcoin achieves this equilibrium by distributing rewards to its
                    network in rough proportion to the quantity of compute a network participant brings to the network,
                    thus creating a market for compute power.</p>
                <p>Bitcoin itself, i.e. the code of the protocol which stitches this equilibrium together, does not
                    itself run any computers, nor in recent years does it even define the way in which computing power
                    proves its existence to the network. Rather, it defines the way in which computing power is
                    <i>validated</i> - that is, the manner in which the computers in the system <i>agree together</i>
                    who has the most computing power and thus the most reward in the system. This is a <strong>digital
                        commodity incentive mechanism</strong>.</p>
                <p>The effects of this abstraction have dazzled many. Over the last 12 years, Bitcoin&#x27;s provable
                    computing power has exceeded 1000x times the equivalent potential of the trillion dollar company
                    Google, and is set to consume more electricity than the entire nation of Australia. But how did
                    Bitcoin achieve this?</p>
                <p>In summary, digital commodity incentive mechanisms are the <i>perfect markets</i>, and perfect
                    markets have the amazing quality that, when aligned, they are unstoppable and unequivocally
                    powerful. For instance, Bitcoin miners worldwide continuously and aggressively find ways to reduce
                    the cost to mine Bitcoin by purchasing cheap hardware, or finding unused lakes of available energy.
                    The system is antifragile, constantly killing off bad competition. It is unclosable. Anyone can
                    join, no questions asked, and contributions get paid <i>directly</i> and<i> continuously</i>, no
                    contracts. No HR department − this is <i>capitalism</i> <!-- -->in its purest form.</p>
                <p>Atomic is like Bitcoin in many ways. It has a transferrable and censorship resistant token, TAO,
                    which runs on a 24/7 decentralized blockchain substrate which is auditable and transparent.
                    Atomic is also run by miners, like Bitcoin, who can exist globally and anonymously.</p>
                <p>Importantly and conversely, Atomic utilizes these same advantages of Bitcoin, which has
                    incentivized its compute network to grow enormously. For instance, when a market is defined on
                    Atomic, miners worldwide continuously and aggressively find ways at reducing the cost to mine TAO
                    on that market; they purchase hardware, stay up all night, and find every way to reduce costs.
                    Procuring all available resources whether from their own home, or from datacenters worldwide, both
                    known and unknown - all to create the digital product of intelligence, or anything and everything
                    the network defines. In essence, we leverage the same killer app.</p>
                <p>Where Atomic differs primarily is the product. Whilst Bitcoin focuses exclusively on the
                    importance of ensuring Bitcoin&#x27;s <i>total resistance</i> to exterior actors and the
                    immutability of its token economic system, Atomic focuses primarily on building value-creating
                    markets.</p>
                <p>Focusing here; the Atomic paradigm is about being a network, computer and language for <i>writing
                        systems</i>, alongside the market which created Bitcoin&#x27;s gargantuan size. However, they
                    fundamentally differ in <i>how</i> they use these resources. Where Bitcoin simply secures its
                    network by creating one trivial product (namely SHA-256 Hashes - which are unusable and not readily
                    transferable into any real problem), Atomic doubles down, allowing the building of multiple
                    intertwined and complementary sub incentive systems, which build out commodities, like data or
                    bandwidth, with real-world, applicable value, culminating ultimately, in<i> intelligence</i>.</p>

                <p class="page_subtitle__JoR3B">Atomic&#x27;s Core Tech</p>
                <p>Arguably, Atomic&#x27;s core technological innovation is the <i>separation</i> of the chain&#x27;s
                    core functioning (transferring funds etc.) from the running of the validation systems which define
                    the markets for its digital commodity creation. This is distinct from Bitcoin, Ethereum, Filecoin
                    and most every digital commodity system on the market today</p>
                <p>Because of this separation, Atomic does not need to have a special purpose language for writing
                    these validation systems. They can be written in Rust, Python, C++, or any other programming
                    language. Furthermore,<i> all of the tools required for validating the subnet mechanisms remain
                        off-chain</i>, allowing them to be potentially extremely data heavy and compute intensive.</p>
                <p>For instance, in Atomic&#x27;s flagship commodity market, Subnet 1, intelligence providers are
                    validated for answering queries using a machine learning model. Those outputs are <i>themselves</i>
                    validated using machine learning models, expensive and large ones, which can subsequently learn and
                    be adapted<i> without any information moving between the validator set and the chain</i>. This would
                    be impossible on nearly any available blockchain.</p>
                <p>What makes this possible is Yuma Consensus (YC). <strong>Yuma Consensus</strong> is the mechanism
                    Atomic runs on its chain, to enforce that there is agreement between the validators of the
                    individual sub mechanisms in Atomic&#x27;s network. By analogy, Yuma Consensus is the central
                    processing unit (CPU) of Atomic. YC takes the varying incentive mechanisms written by developers
                    and transforms them into an<i> incentive landscape</i>, whereby agreement is reached and miners are
                    forced to act in<i>the way defined by the people who write the consensus mechanisms for the
                        individual subnets</i>.</p>
                <p>The unique innovation of YC is that it is<strong> agnostic to what is being measured</strong>, and
                    allows for fuzzy consensus around <i>probabilistic truths</i> - truths like intelligence. Indeed, YC
                    was essential for the validation of intelligence, given the nature of that amorphous information
                    theoretic commodity.</p>
                <p>YC is what makes Atomic fundamentally distinct from various other blockchain projects - most of
                    which write their validation systems <i>directly into their chain</i> and thus make the problem
                    being solved, or the way it is solved, <strong>immutable</strong> down the road. Yuma Consensus has
                    no such limitations.</p>

                <p>The ability to <strong>write a multiplicity of Atomic incentive systems</strong> and have them
                    <strong>concurrently run within a single token ecosystem</strong> is not<i> just cool</i>, it&#x27;s
                    absolutely essential for building decentralized organizations which <i>can compete</i> with large
                    corporations. Google has an AI team, backed by a storage team, plus a compute team all under one
                    roof - whilst you (without Atomic) are forced to use 10 different token economic markets on 10
                    different chains.</p>
                <p>Atomic gives you all of it: an AI team, a storage team, a compute team, and anything else that can
                    be dreamed of - all under a <i>single token framework</i>, turning TAO holders into effective
                    Decentralized Cloud Providers,<strong> backed by an incentivized, adapting and ever-improving
                        infrastructure</strong>. TAO <i>is the bridge</i> between clients and this mega-computer, plus
                    the resources that are being created, through various subnetwork mechanisms, in Atomic. This is
                    the main functionality of TAO. Functionality, which hitherto was only within the reach of immense
                    supercorps like OpenAI, is now accessible - in one <i>non-permissioned </i> place.</p>

                    professionals also understand the potential of decentralizing applications powered by intelligence

                <p>Atomic is open to innovators and, for the first time, developers have the opportunity to monetize
                    their ideas for the grand resource allocation system <i>that they want</i>. Drawing together huge
                    quantities of resources, under incentive driven compute systems -<i>without the need to engage in
                        the creation of an entirely new chain</i>. Atomic provides a platform to build these systems
                    in one place. It thus provides a one-stop-shop for those seeking<!-- --> <i> <!-- -->all the compute
                        requirements for building unstoppable applications on top of an incentivized infrastructure.</i>

                <p class="page_subtitle__JoR3B">Open Markets, Open Ownership</p>
                <p>At its core, Atomic is a horizontally scalable, cryptography-based, resource-allocation protocol
                    that is also open to contribution. However, what makes it so powerful from a technical standpoint is
                    what makes it equally attractive from a humanistic perspective. That&#x27;s because the inverse of
                    Atomic&#x27;s ability to attract resources from the wider world, <strong>is</strong> its ability
                    to distribute real <i>visceral ownership</i> back out to that same world.</p>
                <p>In essence, Atomic&#x27;s permeability to contribution is its permeability to control. You can own
                    the network in the same manner I, as a long-term developer of Atomic, can own it. This is a
                    quality of open ownership systems which, like its predecessor <i>open source software</i>,
                    reevaluates what <i>makes things good</i>.</p>
                <p>In open source we give the code away; in open ownership we give the control away, to the same effect
                    and from the same principle -<strong> <!-- -->that which is the most open to contribution and
                        control is the most open to innovation</strong>, and therefore most likely to align with the
                    largest group of people.</p>
                <p>This is as simultaneously <strong>vital</strong> - the only thing <i>capable</i> of competing with
                    the largest corporations is the <i>unity of everyone </i>- as it is<strong> ethical</strong>. The
                    excessive centralization of control, especially around AI, poses the greatest risk to the human
                    race. The concentration of power<strong> inevitably</strong> creates biased decision-making,
                    controlled access to benefits, and significant abuse.</p>
                <p>Satoshi understood that the centralization of power over money <i>inevitably</i> creates corruption.
                    This is the reason that Bitcoin sought to decentralize finance. This truth maps self-evidently onto
                    humankind&#x27;s most valuable digital resources. AI must not be owned by the few for the same, and
                    exponentially more dangerous, threat.</p>

                <p class="page_subtitle__JoR3B">Conclusion</p>
                <p>It is important to revisit that there is often a parallel between what should be for technological
                    reasons, and what should be for bigger issues facing the human race.</p>
                <p>Technologically, Atomic makes sense;<strong> <!-- -->abstracted computing markets are the most
                        powerful tool humanity has ever had for aligning digital resources.</strong></p>
                <p>And humanistically,<strong> <!-- -->open-ownership systems are tools for the bottom-up placing of
                        these resources, directly into people&#x27;s hands</strong>. Atomic is the ecosystem and TAO
                    is the mycelial network connecting humanity with the future of Artificial Intelligence, such that
                    its control can be ethically united with a life-affirming and truly democratic future for humanity,
                    alongside machines.</p>
                <p>We are approaching a forking point for mankind; down one road is the centralization of power and
                    resources, in large regulated industries, who have entrenched and overbearing access to the
                    best-in-class intelligence and computers. Down the other road is the<strong> <!-- -->potential for
                        sharing these resources through open protocols, via technological foundations, which enable
                        global participation and ownership</strong>.</p>
                <p>Atomic finds itself at the precipice of a completely new-age of computing: supercomputers via
                    abstracted markets. This precedence shines forth by taking the greatest financial innovation our
                    planet has ever seen, then wedding it to the real world: Bitcoin meets Artificial Intelligence. We
                    can do it. We have the people, we have the desire, and we have the technology.</p>
